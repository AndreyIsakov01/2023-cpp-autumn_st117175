One thing I admire about David is his intelligence. He consistently excels in his academics, often earning top grades in his classes. But it`s not just his grades that make him intelligent; he has a natural curiosity and thirst for knowledge that always impresses me. He loves to ask questions and learn about new things, and this curiosity has led him to become an expert in a variety of subjects.
